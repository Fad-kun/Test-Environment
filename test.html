              <strong> Fun Fact: </strong> Did you know that the first
              mobile-friendly website was created in 1997? It was designed for
              the Nokia 7110, a phone that could display simple text and images.
              Fast forward to today, and I'm ensuring that your experience on
              any device is smooth and engaging.
